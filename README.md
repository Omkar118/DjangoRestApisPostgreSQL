This is simple project i made based on REST API.  
What are we doing in this project?  
1.We built REST Server in Django.  
2.We built datamodel to save our posts.(post contains Title & Description)  
3.We built views in order to render the requests sent by client  
4.We tested our API response on Postman and then created Client for the same
